Went for a walk today, my week has been a little tough, so this little moment of peace was much needed.
Along the way I stole a few moments of beauty, mainly pictures of these little flowers, from this angle it kind of looks like they are as tall as forest trees. <a href="#"> Link to instagram picture</a>
