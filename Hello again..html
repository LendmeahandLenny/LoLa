    <p>
      Away I went for clarification

      I am ready

      And though it will be messy,  I have realized that is just the way I am

      And there is nothing better than realization

      There is nothing better than the hope I see and feel today

      I write again, this time with wonder and a goal of making a path

      Through the woods, I shall creep

      As not to alert what is lurking

      I feel as though I am finally ready

      These things will take time, but time is all I have anyway.

      A path leading to the purple

      I see those beautiful fluffy clouds waiting for me

      I cannot express the joy just yet, but in secret, I shall whisper, in hopes, these words will bounce off the wall and land in the mind of a reader

      Sharing is all I have with this time

      And I am ready to share.
