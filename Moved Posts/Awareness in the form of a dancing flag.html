    <p>I am tired of the mess I have been sulking in, I understand that complaining about it will not fix it for me, so it is time to start working to clean up my surroundings.

I can hear the rattles of boxes almost as if my things are packing themselves, I feel as if I am ready to take the first steps, the ones that have been said to lead me down a long comforting path, yet I still feel scared, despite this, I still see me holding myself back, what is she afraid of? I don’t want to be stuck in the same place forever, My mind and I have decided that It is time to move forward, but for some reason, It is hard for me to believe this to be true, the words that climb around my brain, meet and multiply, passing along what they know and see until my head is filled with a song of whispers that consists of all the things I fear to see and hear. It is working, it is keeping me here, I choke out excuse after excuse, every piece of me knows it as a lie, but welcomes it as truth, and I fear that the comfort that comes with these lies will be the hardest part for me to step over, why is letting go so hard when you know it is the right choice? I do not enjoy this guilt, I do not want to pack it with all the things I love and cherish, it could make everything messy if it topples over, and that would just mean more time wasted trying to clean it all up. I am at the gate, and the bin is open, ready to receive whatever I have to give, yet for some reason, I cannot seem to drop it all in, and if I were to, would I end up turning around and dragging the bin with me? Would I be convinced that the problem would be solved then? Would I think covering it was a better solution? I do not want to carry all of these things with me, my bag is not big enough, and even if it were, I do not have the strength to hold something so delicate, so easy to drop, what a mess that would be, and I would be to blame, you take what you can and go, I know this, so why can I not do that? Why do I have to keep disguising the weights as books and letters, nothing that brings this much distress is worth it, I can say that and not move one step through that gate, what way of life is that? To sit chained to the ground watching as all the other ambitious beings find their way in, watching the relief that washes over them as they let go, knowing they just made the right choice, the sound of their feet happily stomping through the mud, the puddles; knowing that in just a short while looking back would be a memory of a time they did something that changed their lives for the better, I want to feel that, I want to see it happen for me, I say this with all the energy I hold inside of me, yet I am still here not making any efforts because of fear, something I cannot see, has taken control over my actions without lifting a finger. I thought being tired would make me move forward, but it seems to have just drained me and makes me want to surrender, even more, I am ashamed, I am hoping the chain rusts fast and falls apart, I am ready to fill up that bin, I am ready to feel the cold metal of the gate against my skin, I am ready to run through the mud, and dance in the puddles, I am ready to look into my mind and smile at the memory of writing this knowing I made it to happiness the way I wanted, I see it as clear as I possibly can, I want it more than anything, being tired isn’t the end, it’s the flag dancing in the wind letting me know it’s the beginning, I will nod my head and bow, thanking it for being so obnoxiously loud that I could not miss it, I will follow suit and dance myself exhausted, because I want better for myself, and no one else should clean up my mess but me. – Babs
