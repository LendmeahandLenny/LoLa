    Hello, I am a person and I like making things, I write from time to time, and up until now, I've kept it all to myself,  but lately I have been thinking a lot about life, and other human beings, the future, and what future me will be doing, whilst thinking about these things, I realized future me could be doing anything I want, if I do what I need to, right now, so, this is me doing that. I have decided that I want to create all kinds of things while I exist here in this time, and the times after this, that I have the ability to exist in.

     My goals for this blog are to feed it and take great care of it, I would like to share all the hobbies that left me during my time in the cave, and so I hope to be doing that. If your eyes (or ears) and brain are friends, then maybe they will enjoy the written posts I will be posting most often until - and after,   I am settled in. I ask not for a house-warming gift, the presence of your being is enough, and I thank you.

    This post is in response to the introduction blog post, so I will respond to the questions that were listed in that post:

    Q & A:

        Q: Why are you blogging publicly, rather than keeping a personal journal?
        A: Well, over the last few months, I came to the realization that I enjoy interacting with other human beings, but only online, I prefer the comfort of my room, and this way, I get both of those things.
        Q: What topics do you think you’ll write about?
        A: Well that all depends on the time, the day, my brain and its friends, some days I will just post about how I'm feeling, maybe a little story of sorts? A meal combination I came up with that you just HAVE to know about,  a DIY project and/or creative adventures I may create for myself, as to get back into hobbies I once loved or wanted to love; all kinds of things, this blog will be as much of a being as I am, at least I hope so.
        Q: Who would you love to connect with via your blog?
        Anyone that comes across it and wants to take a little ride through the different stuff and things - human beings and or whatever being finds this blog and wants to check it out (looking at the aliens).
        Q: If you blog successfully throughout the next year, what would you hope to have accomplished?
        A: Confidence, whether it's with sharing my creations, or with my creations in general; I have been putting the idea of a blog (and other future projects I have in mind) off for a while because I don't feel the things I want to share will be of any interest, so why not keep it to myself? That way of thinking has affected a lot of my projects, and I want to fix that, even if no one finds this blog, or if people find it but don't like it, or choose not to stick around,  I'll keep it to work on my anxiety and to learn how to live with the feelings that come with sharing the things I create.

    Thank you for allowing your eyes/ears to spend a little time on this little babble blog of mine, warm welcomes all around, and a hopeful start to the new year! - Babs
