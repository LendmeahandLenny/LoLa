    <p>There are stones renting the inside of my body,  it is becoming harder for me to empty them out, I thought that I was getting better at catching them before they settled in, but I guess not.  I desperately want to be able to toss them out onto the lawn, but maybe they’re there to act as a sign? The flesh ball needs help, and I don’t know how to send it their way, there is no alarm that I know of, so how am I to prepare? I want more from this clock, but there is nothing more, it’s all on me, and it’s watching me, and we agree that I’m ready, but the stones and flesh have an agreement I know little about; I’m starting to believe that there is nothing left to do, but it feels like those are words of no truth, and that scares me, I am frustrated, I am tired, but most importantly: I am ready, and I say it all the time, I think that is good,  and that makes me happy, but feeling stuck takes that away. <br>

      <br> I can’t remember me, I can’t identify what lives in me most of the time, I feel so heavy, but I am floating, and that should be fun, but it’s terrifying. I dream of floating far away, closer to the happy I see sometimes, we meet, and when we meet it’s not for long, every time it leaves me feeling wrong, raw, exposed in the worst way, I want it all to just leave me, to just go away, I dream of happiness but to become nothing, leaving behind everything that overwhelms me, even if it’s for a little while. <br>

      <br>I told myself that a push was to start, so this is the skin pulled taut around my muscle and bone, shoving in the gentlest of a motion possible, I am ready, we are ready – together, and reading that in my mind sounds like a lie, a lie that travels and dances across the walls of my skull, but this is the proof, the year is ending soon, and this is the first marker, if nothing comes of this, these words will reside, a memory of a time where I was so close to getting the chain in motion, so close to cleaning all the windows and even opening them, letting in the air, allowing it to push out all that we agreed to let go of,  letting the relief cover me. I am terrified of what is to come, but I am also very excited! I do hope that this will be something I come back to, sitting in a lovely place, satisfaction flowing through my being as it is then in that time, only I can make that happen, this is the push.
