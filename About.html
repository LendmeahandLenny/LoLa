Hello, I am a person and I like making things, I make things from time to time, and up until now, I’ve kept it all to myself,  but lately I have been thinking a lot about life, and other human beings, the future, and what future me will be doing. Whilst thinking about these things, I realized future me could be doing anything I want, if I do what I need to, right now, so, this is me doing that. I have decided that I want to create all kinds of things while I exist here in this time, and the times after this, that I have the ability to exist in.

<h2>The Website and Its’ Purpose</h2>.

My goals for this website are to feed it and take great care of it, I would like to share all the hobbies that left me during my time in the cave, and so I hope to be doing that. If your eyes (or ears) and brain are friends, then maybe they will enjoy the written posts I will be posting most often until – and after,   I am settled in. I ask not for a house-warming gift, the presence of your being is enough, and I thank you.

If you’d like to send a house warming gift, you can send me a flower here.
