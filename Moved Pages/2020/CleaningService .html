<!--What I know:
This is about me getting myself together.
The theme and look of the web page will look like some sort of cleaning agency.
Has a phone number that is a secret link.
Will need to model pictures for the trucks etc.
Page title name: ___ Cleaning service. Self sorting service - this could be for more self help focused things, stuff that comes as a result of your actions vs those from others. Party pack - messes left by others/not of your own doing. Inheritance pack - Those passed along and or left to you. Emergency Pack - the quick and to the rescue, panic pack, these packs are  best for in the moment situations.
Taglines: cleaning service that teaches you how to clean.  where we help you sort through all the trash in your life. The cleaning service to help you clean up your life.
Sections: Trash treading (Walking through to make a plan), Sorting (Putting things into place), recycling (Putting the salvage -ables to good use), Selling (Giving these things a new home, can also list dates where fake sells happened that can also be links)
About us: Your cleaning plan is entirely up to you, sort through your trash in whichever order you'd like. (special deals call for: Porting)
First post: This one with an attached pinned anchor thing that can be closed out, it has a link talking about the opening party. Though the first post will be this one, posted as a customer order thing, order placed and or being processed tag.
This particular page comes as a result of me feeling as if I am in need of a cleaning service to help me get my life together. I think making it a page is a good idea since this would be simular to a series.

other page ideas: Happies fun time boast house - for blog posts that relate to more positive stuff. (A bounce house themed page or fun building etc.) or I could do it where each blog post has it's own theme: an ice cream shop for a chill post, insted of trying to create one space for one category of posts. Each post will have its own theme. The asset shop should definitely look like an online shop, you can shop for individual objects or go to the linked full asset pack. This is the blog post, the actual front page will have the logos and such, this page will be linked on the orders page or something, I haven't quite figured out how that will work, but it is important to get the actual blog post ready.

   Subject: __ Cleaning service - A Review <img src="#" alt="Attached image details my emails between the company also showing the offer to write a review on the experience."> <!-- I can include a code that can be put into an order form that can open up a page of helpful videos/ articles iv'e read. or could link to a video playlist etc. with a message to the inbox being: Thank you for your interest in our services, to further show our appreciation, we have included an outline (or something to that affect)--> <br>
<br>   Whether you have found yourself in a mess that you inherited, or maybe the party attenders left without picking up after themselves, or even a bad series of events you thought would work out in your favor, but didn't, there are many situations in life that could lead to the needing of a thorough cleaning service, fret not, as I have found myself buried in a mess of varying types. Sometimes you need a little assistance, there's nothing shameful about reaching out for some help, some messes are just too big to clean up alone, and that's where __ Cleaning service comes in, they provide heavy duty cleaning, while also respecting your privacy, and even allow you to map out the perfect plan for yourself - They also include helpful guides to help you learn how to keep the mess at bay, They also teach you about skills needed to help you to better prepare in the future.
<br>
So, what's my story? How did I end up on my path to finding __ Cleaning service?
<br>Ending notes for a smooth clean up: Know your goals, what is it you're looking to get from their service? It's important to know exactly what your needs are, what you are willing to lose, what you are willing to sift through, and finding the time to be able to start working on it all. What happens afterwards? So it all went well, your life is back on track, maybe there is a fear of things getting messy again.. Take this time to put those skills you learned to use. Figure out which work for you, and give away the ones that don't, sharing is caring afterall!  Know your limits: Be realistic: Don't expect to clean years worth of a mess in as little as a month or week, remind yourself that the mess took years to even be created, it will take some time to come up with an effective plan, to initate it, and to practice the skills needed to ensure it will not return to what it once was. Be kind to yourself: A mess will happen, beating yourself up won't clean it up faster, take that time to practice instead.
