    <h1>Respect The Silence</h1> <br>


 <br>    <p>All I ask is for you to respect the silence, but silence is something that you seem to be afraid of, for you’re always making sound in some way,  in the loudest way.<br>
   <br> The clocks are being washed away, and I am starting to believe there is nothing I can do about it; I fear that this will be my forever, and if that is so, I shall escort myself out, I can no longer bear it.<br>
   <br> I have convinced myself that lonesome is the way in which I should be living, all because in living with you, my insides would rather see themselves out so they will not have to sit through this, I can admit it is a bit silly, but I believe I am in danger, I do not feel safe anymore, and to you, I assume that is a game.<br>
   <br> I wish never to return if I ever get the chance to find a new path, being in this chamber of echos is starting to wear down on me, I notice myself picking up your habits, and I am very upset in knowing this.<br>
   <br> I do not know how to feel about you, but I know for sure that I want nothing to do with who, and what you are; I am so tired of the sounds that escape your body, it is to the point where the thought of you makes me wince, I am truly tired, and being in your space puts me far beyond that, where I lose every bit I have worked hard to obtain, creating the endless cycle of stress and confusion I find myself cuddled with, at least thrice a week; I need to be out, for my own sake, I cannot allow the cycle to keep going,  especially when it is not the doing of my own.<br>
   <br> You crave respect, yet you yourself do not even know how to give it.<br>
   <br> I will hold on until I can be free, but my hands are starting to lose their grip, and I’m not sure how much longer I have left.<br>
   <br> There is a movie that plays on repeat in my mind, one of which I try so hard to ignore, but it just further stands as proof that you cannot be trusted, and maybe I am paranoid, maybe I am overreacting, regardless, you leave me no choice, I no longer feel connected to you, the judgment seeps from behind your eyes, you are not good at hiding it like you think; I understand that you are trying, and so, I shall leave you to try, I cannot live this way anymore, a way in which you seem to be okay with, so I do hope that my leaving won’t be much of a damper on that, I have reached out, but nothing has been done, and so, that will be the answer I take with me, the answer that leads me to the path of happiness, the path that will allow me to laugh at the past, not use it as a way of survival.<br>
   <br> I truly cannot believe how oblivious you seem to be, what did happen to you? I do not remember you presenting this way, but maybe I have been excusing you for too long, an endless cycle of the both of us enabling one another, a life I wish not to live; it has done nothing but set me back, but I do thank you for your efforts.<br>
   <br> Your intentions are unclear, and that frightens me greatly, the flag doesn’t set you on fire as it does me, I see that now, and even that is starting to make its way to me; I refuse to let it win, that is a life of misery.<br>
   <br> I fear you will not understand; the many times I have tried to teach you proves that to be so. Why are you so good at mixing the pot? Changing the recipe even after it is done? You make it so hard to want to understand and support you, I truly do wish you the best, I know that telling you these things will do nothing, so if you shall ever find this, it will be of your own doing, for I cannot bear any other conflict with the both of you,  I see that it is a joke now, laugh your stomach tight when I leave, don’t feel sorrow, don’t feel pain, for you laughed in my face anyway.<br>
   <br> I do not hate you, I just need the happiness, and it has been shown that happiness, the one in which I seek, cannot exist here, and I shall not stick around to see how bad it can get, for the sake of my dwindling mental state, the result of years of turmoil, the only gift of yours I’ll be forced to keep, and boy do you have expensive taste, I could never afford the things in which I need to be repaired, let alone maintain what I have left, I fear that one day I will be reduced to a crazed maniac, unable to detect the reality, it is already happening, that I prefer to waste my days floating in my head because it is all that keeps me feeling sane, so I shall go where I can, making the best of what has been left from all the places I have had the unfortunate luck of meeting. I am grateful, despite what you have said, but I am also tired, and I refuse to be run down to where my dreams stay inside my skull, tormenting me.<br>
   <br> Please, when I go, respect the silence, for I warned you many times, this is no wolf I cry, I will be sure to prove it.  -Babs
